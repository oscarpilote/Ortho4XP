Linux (Debian derived, names might slightly differ for other distros)
-----

sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-requests python3-numpy python3-pyproj python3-gdal python3-shapely python3-rtree python3-pil python3-pil.imagetk p7zip-full

(if some of them were note packaged for your distro you can use pip instead, like say, pip install pyproj)


Windows
-------

1) Download and install Python 3 from www.python.org 

Just select one for your Windows OS, there is no benefit in our case to 
donwload the pretty lastest version of Python, since you might get difficulties 
further down to find modules already built for it. As of 01/2018, I would 
recommend using 3.5 or 3.6.    
Make sure during the process that "pip" (package management system for Python)
is installed along and made accessible from your PATH [there used to be a checkbox
for this during the Python install process].  

2) Download the following packages from https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/

Pyproj, Numpy, Gdal, Shapely, Rtree, Pillow

Pay attention to take the ones that correspond to the Python version which you picked
at Step 1) and to your OS nbr of bits (32 or 64, I guess 64 in all but a few cases).
As an example, if Python 3.5.*  was selected at Step 1) above and you
have a 64bit windows, then you would choose these files that have -cp35- and _amd64 
within their filename.    

3) From a command window launch successively 

pip install --upgrade pip  [if this goes wrong you probably missed the last point in 1)]
pip install requests
pip install *******.whl [replacing ******** successively by each of the files downloaded at Step 2]

You should be done. Open a command window in the Ortho4XP directory (freshly downloaded from Github)
and launch "python Ortho4XP_v130.py".

OS X
----
1) Install homebrew (a package manager which will NEVER put any mess on your system since it is sandboxed)
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"


2) Install Brew based dependencies
brew install python3 imagemagick spatialindex p7zip

3) Install python based dependencies
pip3.6 install numpy overpy requests Image Pyproj shapely rtree pillow

Launch with "python Ortho4XP_v130.py".
