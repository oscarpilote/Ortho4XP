NOTICE 1. Windows users: Only use Notepad++ or an equivalent decent editor 
to read or modify Ortho4XP related files. Notepad doesn't understand linux 
line-ends and will create a mess. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTICE 2 : Windows users: You do not need to read further than this 
notice if you have installed the binary windows version !
In your case, the executable file is Binary/Ortho4XP_v130.exe, and the 
only advisable action is to make a short-cut to it somewhere, e.g. in the
main Ortho4XP directory (but the executable needs to stay where it is). 
If you end-up installing the python modules some day (to get more frequent
updates or bugs fixed), the Binary directory won't be necessary anymore. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following instructions are for the script install :

Linux (Debian derived, names might slightly differ for other distros)
-----

sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-requests python3-numpy python3-pyproj python3-gdal python3-shapely python3-rtree python3-pil python3-pil.imagetk p7zip-full libnvtt-bin

(if some of them were note packaged for your distro you can use pip instead, like say, pip install pyproj)


Windows
-------

1) Download and install Python 3 from www.python.org 

Just select one for your Windows OS, there is no benefit in our case to 
download the pretty lastest version of Python, since you might get difficulties 
further down to find modules already built for it. As of 10/2018, I would 
recommend using 3.7.    
Make sure during the process that "pip" (package management system for Python)
is installed along and made accessible from your PATH [there is a checkbox
for this during the Python install process wich by default ISN'T checked].  

2) Download the following packages from https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/

Pyproj, Numpy, Gdal, Shapely, Rtree, Pillow (or alternatively Pillow-SIMD)

Pay attention to take the ones that correspond to the Python version which you picked
at Step 1) and to your OS nbr of bits (32 or 64, I guess 64 in all but a few cases).
As an example, if Python 3.7.*  was selected at Step 1) above and you
have a 64bit windows, then you would choose these files that have -cp37- and _amd64 
within their filename.   

In order to use the build geotiff feature of the custom_zl map, you will need to 
add the directory containing gdal_translate and gdalwarp (***/python**/lib/site-packages/osgeo/) 
into your PATH variable.

Finally, if you do not already have them : download and install the build tools for visual studio (2017):
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/fr/downloads/  

3) From a command window launch successively 

pip install --upgrade pip  [if this goes wrong you probably missed the last point in 1)]
pip install requests
pip install *******.whl [replacing ******** successively by each of the files downloaded at Step 2]

You should be done. Open a command window in the Ortho4XP directory (freshly downloaded from Github)
and launch "python Ortho4XP_v130.py".

OS X
----

1) In a Terminal window, install Homebrew (brew.sh), a package manager
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

2) Go to the Ortho4XP folder
cd /path/to/Ortho4XP

3) Execute the install script (you may have to run "chmod +x ./install_mac.sh" first)
./install_mac.sh

4) Launch Ortho4XP
python3 Ortho4XP_v130.py
