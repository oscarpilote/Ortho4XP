NOTICE 1. Windows users: Only use Notepad++ or an equivalent decent editor 
to read or modify Ortho4XP related files. Notepad doesn't understand linux 
line-ends and will create a mess. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTICE 2 : Windows users: You do not need to read further than this 
notice if you have installed the binary windows version !
In your case, the executable file is Binary/Ortho4XP_v130.exe, and the 
only advisable action is to make a short-cut to it somewhere, e.g. in the
main Ortho4XP directory (but the executable needs to stay where it is). 
If you end-up installing the python modules some day (to get more frequent
updates or bugs fixed), the Binary directory won't be necessary anymore. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following instructions are for the script install :

Linux
-----

For Arch-based distributions you must have the AUR enabled and yay installed.
Debian based distributions should have no issues.

1) Install Python
Debian Based: sudo apt-get python3.9
Arch Based: sudo pacman -S python3.9

2) Install Poetry
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/install-poetry.py | python -

3) Install GDAL
Debian Based: sudo apt-get python3-gdal
Arch Based: sudo pacman -S python3-gdal

4) Go to the Ortho4XP folder
cd /path/to/Ortho4XP

5) Install other dependencies
poetry install

6) Launch Ortho4XP
poetry run python Ortho4XP_v130.py


Windows
-------

1) Download and install Python 3.9 from www.python.org 

2) Install Poetry from https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation

3) Go to the Ortho4XP folder
cd \path\to\Ortho4XP

4) From a command window run
poetry install

5) Download GDAL from  from https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#gdal

Pay attention to take the ones that correspond to the Python version which you picked
at Step 1) and to your OS nbr of bits (32 or 64, I guess 64 in all but a few cases).
As an example, for Python 3.9.* and if you
have a 64bit windows, then you would choose these files that have -cp39- and _amd64 
within their filename.

Finally, if you do not already have them : download and install the build tools for visual studio (2017):
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/fr/downloads/  


4) Install GDAL into python
poetry run pip install <filepath>

E.g poetry run pip install ./GDAL‑3.3.2‑cp39‑cp39‑win_amd64.whl

5) You should be done. Open a command window in the Ortho4XP directory (freshly downloaded from Github)
and launch "poetry run python Ortho4XP_v130.py".

OS X
----

1) In a Terminal window, install Homebrew (brew.sh), a package manager
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

2) Go to the Ortho4XP folder
cd /path/to/Ortho4XP

3) Execute the install script (you may have to run "chmod +x ./install_mac.sh" first)
./install_mac.sh

4) Launch Ortho4XP
poetry run python3 Ortho4XP_v130.py
